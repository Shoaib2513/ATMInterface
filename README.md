# 💳 ATM Interface – Java Console Application

A simple Java-based console application that simulates the basic operations of an ATM machine. It allows users to login using a 4-digit PIN, check their account balance, deposit or withdraw money with expense tracking, and change their PIN. The PIN is securely stored in a local file (`userpin.txt`) and updated when the user changes it.
